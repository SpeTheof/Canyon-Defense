# Canyon Defense - Game Rules & Guide

## 🎮 Overview

**Canyon Defense v2.9 "UI Optimization"** is a tower defense game where you must defend your base from waves of enemies by building and upgrading towers along their path.

**Vibe Coded by:** Aura & Spe  
**Music:** "Tiger Swag Killah!" by SpeTheof

## 🎯 Objective

Survive all waves of enemies without letting them reach your base! Each enemy that reaches your base costs you 1 life. When lives reach 0, it's game over.

---

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Left Click:** Place selected tower on rocky areas (not on path)
- **Click Tower:** Open management menu (upgrade/sell)
- **Spacebar:** Start next wave immediately
- **1/2/3 Keys:** Toggle game speed (1x, 2x, 5x)

---

## 🏗️ Tower Upgrade System (NEW!)

### Overview
All towers can now be upgraded from Level 1 to Level 3 for maximum strategic depth!

### How to Upgrade
1. **Click on any tower** to select it
2. A context menu will appear showing:
   - Current level and stats
   - **UPGRADE** button with cost
   - **SELL** button with refund amount
3. Click **UPGRADE** to enhance the tower

### Upgrade Costs & Stats

| Level | Cost | Damage Bonus | Range Bonus | Fire Rate Bonus |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 → 2 | 50% of base | +20% | +15% | +10% |
| 2 → 3 | 100% of base | +40% | +30% | +20% |

### Visual Indicators
- **Level 1**: No marker (base state)
- **Level 2**: One chevron (^) displayed above tower
- **Level 3**: Two chevrons (^^) displayed above tower

### Sell Value

## 💰 Zone Control Bonus System (NEW!)

### Concept
Aggressive players who intercept enemies early are rewarded with bonus gold!

### How It Works
- Track each enemy's progress along the path (0% to 100%)
- If an enemy is **killed before reaching 50%** of the map:
  - **+25% Bonus Gold** awarded immediately
  - Yellow floating text "+$BONUS" appears at kill location
- **No bonus** if enemy passes 50% threshold

### Example
- Enemy reward: $20
- Zone Control Bonus: +$5 (25%)
- **Total**: $25 for early kills

### Strategy Tip
Place towers near the start of the map to maximize Zone Control bonuses!

| Speed | Use Case |
